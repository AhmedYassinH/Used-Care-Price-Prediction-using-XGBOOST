# Used-Care-Price-Prediction-using-XGBOOST
in this Notebook (which is Part of a Guided Project Course) I compared the Performance of three Machine Learning Algorithms :
1. Decision Tree Regressor.
2. Random Forsedt Regressor.
3. XGBOOST Regressor.

The data was for used cars prices and the task was to predict the price of a used car.
